# DataScape: Mastering Database Design

### About the Project
This project is part of the comprehensive ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding. By working through these tasks, learners will design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality. The project simulates a production-level database system, emphasizing high standards of design, development, and data handling.

### Key Highlights
***Task 1*** : Craft a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database design, ensuring clear relationships and properly defined entities.

***Task 2***: Apply normalization principles to refine your database design, optimizing data integrity and minimizing redundancy.

***Task 3***: Create SQL scripts to define the database schema, incorporating primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for optimal query performance.

***Task 4***: Populate the database with real-world sample data, simulating an Airbnb-like environment with users, properties, bookings, and payments.

Each task builds on the previous one, providing a step-by-step approach to developing a robust database system. By completing this project, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with real-world database challenges, preparing you for complex projects in professional environments.
